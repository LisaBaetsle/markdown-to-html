<h1>Markdown</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Repository name: markdown-challenge</li>
    <li>Mode: solo, and as a class</li>
    <li>Type of Challenge: learning</li>
    <li>Duration: Â½ day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this challenge you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Write structured content using the Markdown syntax</li>
    <li>Write a README file in Markdown, and push it to GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: write Markdown, and not HTML (this will come tomorrow) ðŸ˜‰</p>

<h2>The Mission</h2>
<p>For this exercise, you will create a personal profile page in Markdown, and push it to GitHub. All your profile pages will be linked one to the other, so that you have a comprehensive list of people for the whole class.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Create a repository called markdown-challenge on GitHub</li>
    <li>Clone the repository locally on your computer (I suggest you place this repository - and the future ones - inside a folder called BeCode)</li>
    <li>Create a file called README.md, add it to the repository, commit it, and push the changes</li>
    <li>Fill the README with the following content:</li>
</ol>

<div class="example">
    <p>Your Name (as a large header)</p>
    <p>An inspirational quote in italics</p>
    <p>A (professional) photo of yourself (you can save the file in the repository next to the README file)</p>
    <p>"Me, in one sentence" (as a smaller header)</p>
    <p>A table with the following structure:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Birthday: dd/mm</p>
    <p>Favorite color: ?</p>
    <p>Favorite food: ?</p>
    <p>Pinneapple on pizza: Yes/No (Extra challenge: make it look like a (un)checked checkbox)</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Hobbies (smaller header)</p>
    <p>This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies</p>
    <p>At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like.</p>
    <p>You can always count on me when... (smaller header)</p>
    <p>Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make.</p>
    <p>This could be technical, making people feel comfortable, being an organiser...</p>
    <p>A funny story (smaller header)</p>
    <p>Tell a short funny story about your life.</p>
    <p>TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)</p>
    <p>Summarise your funny story in one short sentence.</p>
    <p>! IMPORTANT -> At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.</p>
    <p>Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.</p>
    <p>The links should have the following structure:</p>
    <p><< previous || YOUR NAME || next >>"</p>
</div>
